# W3F Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** Nomis
- **Team Name:** Nomis
- **Payment Address:** 0xD587404cd28Bf4eE059ac84a6B7C0219d05EA6CF (DAI)
- **[Level](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master#level_slider-levels):** 3

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Nomis is an on-chain protocol based on a mathematical prediction and AI model enabling protocol users with a favorable on-chain credit score to borrow crypto with a fair collateral and APR on a case-by-case basis. On the other hand, Nomis is an open-source protocol that helps web3 developers both building new on-chain solutions and use cases, and balancing already existing high-TVL protocols.

We are going to land our protocol on top of Polkadot to make it possible for developers to create better DeFi solutions.

We strive to give an access to capital for a sufficiently broader group of people around the world, who can’t afford (or don’t want to go with) >125% collateral, but at the same time has a good credit score based on her on-chain history.

### Project Details

Nomis is at the MVP stage now. Our prototype is able to calculcate your ETH wallet's credit score based on on-chain data available. Please feel free to [test it](https://nomis.cc/).
_PS Nomis Credit Score of Vitalik's wallet is 73.73% :)_

To be clear in our roadmap let’s see our plan step by step.
  1. Data extraction from the protocol & initial parameters calculation;
  2. Credit score calculation via Nomis' AI-algorithm; Web3 login connection to boost UX;
  3. API & documentation development.

You can find more information about the algorithm, team and its previous experience in our [whitepaper](https://artemshtlv.notion.site/e859b9e3bae6412fb99d6119a8d2e5a4#983f0507df904460aaaf7ef95e847798). You can also visit our [Github repository](https://github.com/fc-ha/Nomis.ETH).

### Ecosystem Fit

1. Nomis will help Polkadot to grow its MAD as developers can be interested to build unique DeFi DApps on Polkadot using Nomis credit score, as it provides them with opportunity to extremely customize initial customer terms and offers (lending/borrowing) on a case-by-case basis. which is getting more and more adoption.
2. Nomis will help Polkadot and its ecosystem to grow TVL and MAU as a result of on-chain acquisition of mainstream borrowers who are interested in the DeFi solutions mentioned above.

Currently Nomis have no competitors on Polkadot. Although, Nomis brings two crucial competitive advantages vs other on-chain credit scores such as Chainscore (NEAR), RociFi (Polygon), Spectral Finance (Ethereum), Project Galaxy and TrueFi (Multichain), etc. to the table:
  1. Nomis is an open-source solution that helps web3 developers leverage credit scores building better on-chain products and communities.
  2. Nomis offers the most robust financial snapshot of a potential borrower hiring hierarchy analysis as a scoring method.

## Development Status :open_book:

We are at the MVP stage now. The previous steps are (1) initial documentation and whitepaper development, (2) proof-of-concept.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 3 months
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 10
- **Total Costs:** $50,000

### Milestone 1: Data extraction from the protocol; Basic attribute calculation (on-chain data and transaction history)
Deliverables:
  - Code for attribute extraction
  - Landing with calculated attributes
Deadline: 09/01/2022
Cost: $15,000

### Milestone 2: Credit score calculation via Nomis' AI-algorithm; Web3 login connection to boost UX
Deliverables:
  - Code for credit score calculation
  - Web-wallet integration
Deadline: 10/01/2022
Cost: $15,000

### Milestone 3: API & documentation development
Deliverables:
  - API for credit score calculation
  - Documentation for using API
  - Personal area to API stats
Deadline: 11/01/2022
Cost: $20,000

## Future Plans

In the future, we are going to make Nomis self-sufficient hiring the business model based on fee-charging (1%) per API usage.

The long-term vision for Nomis goes far beyond credit scoring for DeFi. Other dApps will use Nomis Score as a wallet qualifier for making job offers, for adding in whitelists, for offering special marketing terms, or just for inviting to a private party.
